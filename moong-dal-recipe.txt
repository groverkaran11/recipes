stir well and pressure cook till the dal is cooked and soft.
once the pressure settles down, remove the lid and stir the dal.
if the dal looks thick, then add some water and simmer for 1-2 minutes. add salt and keep aside.
in a small pan, heat oil or ghee or butter. first fry the cumin seeds.
next add the garlic and green chili and fry for some seconds.
don't brown the garlic. switch off the flame.
now add the garam masala powder, red chili powder and asafoetida.
switching off the flame ensures that the spice powders don't get burned.
you can also fry the spice powders on a low flame.
make sure you don't burn them.
stir and immediately pour the tempering mixture in the dal.
stir the moong dal and serve hot moong dal with steamed rice or chapatis.
the moong dal tastes better as it is and there is no need to garnish or add coriander leaves to it.
